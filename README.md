ABOUT
I am currently pursuing an Integrated MCA at Parul University. As for my background, during the course of my studies.
I managed to grasp the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, Java, Oracle, communication networking, software development and data structures. 
This significantly equipped me for the working environment. Also, participated in several hackathons and projects, like the online vegetable market. 
These experiences out of school were valuable in learning how to work as part of a group, overcoming obstacles and using what has been learned in theory in practice. 
On a personal level, I am quite flexible and good at problem solving.
I am currently seeking internship and fresher job opportunities in web development and software development roles.
